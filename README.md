###### Adv. options

You can set additional option `BuildScript` to define the path to the shell script that should be used to build packages. It will be executed inside the source tree of a package. The script should install the library to the output directory defined by the `INSTALL_TO` environment variable. The code should be compiled with the `-g -Og` GCC options.

If you just want to add some configure options then you can define the `Configure` option of the profile.

The other option `SourceDir` allows to index packages from a local directory instead of downloading them from `SourceUrl`.

###### Adv. usage

  For advanced usage, see output of `-help` option.
